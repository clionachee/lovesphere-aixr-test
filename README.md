lovesphere ai-xr test with OpenAI, A-Frame &amp;Glitch

It's my first attempt of using AI to only use HTML for the XR interactive moves.
Pretty simple and fun.
Use A, W, S, D to navigate and we shall see how it works.

Test it out here: [https://lovesphere-aixr-test.glitch.me/thelovesphere.html](https://lovesphere-aixr-test.glitch.me/thelovesphere.html)
